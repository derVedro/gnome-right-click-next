**Gnome extension for sending windows to the next workspace by right-clicking them in the overview.**

This is a Gnome 49 ready fork of the dusty old extension
[Right Click Down](https://gitlab.com/criztovyl/gnome-right-click-down) by
[criztovyl](https://github.com/criztovyl) with shamelessly stolen parts of the awesome
[middleclickclose](https://github.com/p91paul/middleclickclose) extension to make it all work.


You can install the extension either via the
[gnome extensions website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7600/right-click-next/)
or by extracting the release archive into the `$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` directory
(make sure the archive creates a separate directory).
